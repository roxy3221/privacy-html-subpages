    <h1>Understanding AI in Canada: Avoiding Bias and Fair Access for Newcomers</h1>

    <h2>What is AI?</h2>
    <p>
      AI (Artificial Intelligence) is technology that learns from huge amounts of data, including personal information,
      to create things like text, images, or videos. For example, if you ask an AI tool to write a story, it might give
      you a different version each time, even if you ask the same question.
    </p>

    <h2>Why AI Matters in Canada</h2>
    <p>
      AI is changing every part of life in Canada. It can help solve big problems, like improving healthcare or fighting
      climate change. It can also create new jobs and help the economy grow. But many people worry that AI is developing
      too fast, making it hard to control its risks.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary>Risks of AI for Newcomers</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bias and Discrimination:</strong> AI may favor people with “Canadian-sounding” names or exclude newcomers if trained on unfair data.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Concerns:</strong> AI often collects personal data, which could be misused or leaked.</li>
        <li><strong>Job Loss Fears:</strong> Some fear AI may replace human jobs in service or manufacturing roles.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What Canadians Think About AI</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Many people don’t fully understand how AI works or its limits.</li>
        <li>Hopes include better healthcare, education, and solutions to climate change.</li>
        <li>Fears include bias, privacy breaches, and job insecurity.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How to Make AI Fair for Everyone</summary>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Teach AI Basics:</strong> Everyone should learn how AI works — not just experts.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix Bias in Data:</strong> AI should be trained on fair, diverse data.</li>
        <li><strong>Include Everyone:</strong> Newcomers and vulnerable groups should be part of AI decisions.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Key Message for Newcomers</summary>
      <p>
        AI can improve lives, but it must be used carefully. As a newcomer, you have the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask how AI is used in decisions that affect you (e.g., jobs, healthcare).</li>
        <li>Demand fairness if you suspect bias.</li>
        <li>Learn about AI to protect yourself and your community.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

        and use technology safely. Stay curious, ask questions, and seek resources to stay informed!
